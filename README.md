# Computational Biology Final Project


## Description
This is our final project in the course computational biology.
The project is divided into 3 different parts:

Part A:
In this part we analysed a GenBank file for the virus Bacillus subtilis.
We calculated its various genetic components and lengths, analysed the GC count,
All of the data was then displayed with graphs and visuals using Matplotlib.

Part B:
In this part we analysed proteins acquired from Uniprot.
The proteins were compared to the standard genbank format,
The data was also displayed visually.
In addition - we analysed the Transmembrane proteins and learned important facts about them.

Part C:
In this part we genetically compared 2 different Corona virus strains and 
found the similar genes that they shared. The virus has evolved over time and 
This can be seen by comparing the DN/ds ratio between the old and new virus strains.


### Dependencies
Run the project with python 3.9.7 and above.

### Executing program

Once files are unzipped:  
*open with Pycharm  
*To run the project run main.py   

##notes:
Only histograms and graphs will be shown on the screen.
All the data will be written into "automated_answer_file.txt" file.
